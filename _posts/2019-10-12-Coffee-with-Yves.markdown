Today I met up up with an old friend, collaborator, roommate and classmate (we met on this same course in 2014). At this moment in time, I would say that Yves and myself are in sync with our creative ideas, and he will be an incredibly important contributor to this project. He now lives in East Anglia so our IRL contact is limited, but when it does happen is all the more special because of this. Today we discussed ideas regarding a new musical project that we plan to attempt- a band with real instruments, something that is new to me. We plan on taking inspiration from folk/medieval aesthetics as well as experimental electronic music. I told him about the midi and ___ control I learnt about in the networks workshop, and how we could essentially use a phone or tablet as a performance tool. We also discussed the collaborative network we are attempting to piece together, and the different ways we could use it to work closely and efficiently- even in our solo work. For example, we plan to have a preset bank for the synths we use. This will allow us to use and work from sounds others have made- speeding up the process for those who aren’t experienced in synthesis, and also giving all who exist on the network a similar identifiable aesthetic. 

We also discussed ideas to do with film work, and from this conversation I had the idea to use parties as  an integral setting to my films for this project. The reason for this being that they can act as interesting depictions of the current culture, especially when they are contrasted with other parties from other scenes. 

Before we parted, we set a date for when we will next meet up and attempt to create some music  together (the band project). Our aim is to have something recorded and ‘finished’ from the first day- this deadline will help to motivate us, as well as not allow us the time to get overly ‘perfectionist’ about it.
