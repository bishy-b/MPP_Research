Having completed some research on file sharing platforms, for this project I have decided to go with Syncthing. It is similar in use to Dropbox, only it works using peer-to-peer networking (p2p) as opposed to using a centralised storage server. When deciding on digital tools and services, I always try to avoid using the ‘big tech’ data corporations. Not only is this for security/privacy reasons, but choosing to use one of their services usually means you will be storing data in huge server farms, which are incredibly energy intensive. As well as this decision to boycott being informed by my environmental politics, it also alines with the wider aims of this project: to try and create an alternative means of existing as a musician in as many aspects as possible. In order to achieve this with the digital aspects of the project, p2p sharing and open-source software are preferred.

With Syncthing, the plan is to create a shared file repository where each ‘node’ can add and use whatever they want to. It will be used for audio samples and recordings, project stems (so people can collaborate freely without the original creator needing to be notified), as well as film and pictures. The hope is that this pulling together of resources will breed new forms of creativity, create new dimensions  of creative relationships, all sharing an emerging unique style. 

As mentioned in a previous post, The Field social centre in New Cross is a central inspiration for this project, and this online network is leaning heavily on what I have learnt from my membership there. I have realised that, although you are required to put work in, having access to the fruits of a group of people’s labour is incredibly rewarding. In my network’s case, people will be expected to create new sounds and musical tools for the archive if they want to use it. I am hoping that this will breed an intimate new culture of our own which will be priceless.
