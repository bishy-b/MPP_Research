Today I attended a screening of ‘The Miracle of the Sargosso Sea’ by Greek film maker Syllas Tzoumerkas, as a part of the BFI film festival which is on throughout the city. This is the first time I have been to the cinema in years and it proved to be a refreshing experience. Although I wasn’t blown away by the film as a whole, there were a couple aspects  that I found interesting. For one, I liked the portrayal of the inescapable claustrophobia that comes with a rural, small town existence. Being from the ‘middle of nowhere’ myself, it was fun to see a familiar feeling being translated creatively, through dialogue, editing and mise-en-scene. I also liked the non-diegetic sound design, specifically from the scenes which served as dream-like excursions from the primary narrative. I loved how jarring the audio editing was, and how confidently done it came across. I will return to these scenes and use them as inspiration for the score and editing of my film once the time comes.
