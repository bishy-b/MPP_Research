My initial inspiration for this project came to me this summer just gone, having ramped up the amount of time and energy I was committing to The Field – a social centre in New Cross. For various reasons, the membership of the organization had rapidly dropped in the first half of the year, which left a space for me to take on most of the work at the ‘Pay-what-you-can Kitchen’ every Wednesday. This came about not long after I had completed a Sound Culture essay, where I had began my research into Mark Fisher, Simon Reynolds and Alex Williams ideas in regards to ‘stagnation’ within 21st century electronic dance music culture. A quote from Mark Fisher in a panel discussion has stuck with me since hearing it:

“The attack on work is absolutely a crucial thing. The shadow of work is over us at all times, even and especially when we are unemployed or under employed. A crucial phase is to recover this attack on work. It was good that people weren’t working a lot of the time, and that’s why the culture was vibrant, because there was a space for people not to be working.” 

“Work in a way, you can say is anything that you don’t want to do. [...]This scene was not supported by major labels, it was self supporting via its own kind of market dynamics which weren’t those of corporate capital at all. And that sense of a highly experimental scene which could sustain itself outside of the dynamics of capital. That was a part of why this was an important moment.” (CTM Festival 2013 – Death of Rave Panel Discussion)

For me, the link between the lack of new ideas within music, and the growing necessity for people to be filling their time with waged work is clear. I would go one step further than Fisher and say that this existence outside of the corporate capital system is fundamental to any attempts to invent the radically new. Although The Field isn’t providing financially to it’s members (out of ideological choice not because of a lack of funds), it does allow for the sharing of skills and free food, the use of a practical workspace whenever its needed, and the networking of like-minded individuals, all of which are part of the foundations of an alternative economy.

Since this revelation, I am treating The Field as a central case study for a similar Social Network based around music production that I am planning to create for my MPP, as a pragmatic response to Fisher’s lament. I will be taking inspiration from the organizational principles of The Field (working groups, regular meetings, membership contracts) and translating them into collaborative processes for our motley crew of musicians and artists. 

INCLUDE KITCHEN FLYER AND FIELD ONE TOO
