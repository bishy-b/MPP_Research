Today’s workshop was based on the idea of building a preamplifier for a contact mic. Apparently this would act as a solution to the ‘high pass filter problem’ of standard contact mics. The impedance mismatch creates a high pass filter which produces the scratchy, claustrophobic sound usually associated with contact mic recordings. This preamp eliminates this and allows the capture of low end, giving the recordings a frequency spectrum more akin to the whole range of the human ear. 

Although the kits weren’t ready for us to take and work on, we spent the class looking at examples of pieces of work made using contact mics, which proved to be useful. 

The technician running the workshop- Michael, spent a while showing us indepth, the work of Toshiya Tsunoda. Tsunoda uses a variety of recording techniques in order to capture the inherent movement of all things. Walls, stairwells, pipes, concrete foundations etc. In the series of work that Michael showed us, he had collected recordings from different areas of a port in Japan. These pieces are made up of clicks, hisses and undulating low frequencies and mechanical wines. Even though I have heard some work from this artist before, I am thankful for Michael for allowing enough time to dig into the motives behind the artist’s choices, as it made me consider the work in a more thoughtful way. Because of this, I realised that I could experiment with similar techniques for my film project. Instead of composing a score for the footage of the parties/spaces I am interested in from scratch, I could take contact/electromagnetic recordings and use them as a starting point. I am going to an event tomorrow evening (where I was hoping to interview an artist for my dissertation), and I have booked out some microphones in the hope of making some test recordings there.
