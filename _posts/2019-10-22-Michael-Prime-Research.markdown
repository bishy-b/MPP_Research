At the end of my first tutorial with Steve, he told me to go away and research Michael Prime’s work with plants, as a basis for the sonic element of my sound system/sculpture piece. The idea we discussed was building a working sound system out of found/unwanted materials, and turning it into a herbarium (of sorts). To tie these two disparate elements together would/could be a form of plant protein music (compositions based on frequencies that have been discovered to encourage the growth of certain aspects of different plants). 

I have found it somewhat challenging to find much information about Prime, or access recordings of his work. I discovered that he studied ecology and worked in conservation before becoming known in the experimental electronic music world. I have managed to find some pieces of his from his album ‘L-Fields’ online which I have given a listen. They are compositions made using the bioelectrical field of halucinogenic plants. I found this to be an interesting listen, imagining the different experiences that come with each plant’s ingestion. They include field recordings, which I found to be a bit distracting, as they took me out of the introspective mindset that I consider to hand in hand with both a psychadelic experience, and with the idea of plant-produced music. I did really enjoy the ‘trippy’ synthesized frequencies, possessing an almost ASMR-like psycho-acoustic quality.

From this artist bio about his practice, it says that “he developed a technique allowing him to interact with plants, translating variations in their bioelectrical field into sound produced by an oscillator.”

My next step is to research scientific techniques of interacting with plants through sound. Although for my project, I am more interested in composing music for plants, as opposed to from them. I have heard the term ‘protein music’ a couple times, which I think is music that stimulates the growth of specific proteins within plants.
