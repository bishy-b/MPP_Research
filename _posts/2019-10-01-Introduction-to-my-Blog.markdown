Hi, 
On this blog I will be documenting the research I will undertake for my Major Project Portfolio for the 3rd year of the Sound Arts & Design BA I am studying at UAL. I have decided to create the site using Jekyll- a static site generator as it fits my needs perfectly. I initially started a Wordpress.com blog but was soon irritated by the lack of control and features (unless you buy a paid account). 
As it states in the Jekyll ‘README’ file:

“Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.”

I feel that having the ability to control all aspects of the site, and by creating it from scratch , using Jekyll ties in nicely with the content I plan to research/create for this project.
